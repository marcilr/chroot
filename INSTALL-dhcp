Non-authoritative version of DHCP server

The version 3 DHCP server is now non-authoritative by default.

This means that if a client requests an address that the server knows
nothing about and the address is incorrect for that network segment, the
server will _not_ send a DHCPNAK (which tells the client it should stop
using the address.) If you want to change this behavior, you must
explicitly state in dhcpd.conf what network segments your server is
authoritative for using the 'authoritative' statement.
