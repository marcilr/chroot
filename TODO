+++ Embed version number in resultant pdf filename.


Complete
========
x Mar 15, 2010 - Fixed dist target to use tar --exclude rather than use
cp.  Much cleaner:

dist: ${PDF} mostlyclean
        ${TAR} --exclude=".svn" -cvjpf ${BZ2} *

 Mar 14, 2010 - The Makefile dist file uses:
${CP} build.xml chroot.pdf figsize.sty Makefile TODO ${DIST}
${CP} chroot.tex.in INSTALL-dhcp README VERSION ${DIST}

This should use the more abstract:
${CP} -r !(${DIST}) ${DIST} 

Rather than a long series of values.  The above line breaks make.
Likely does not like the "!" exclamation point.


x Mar 14, 2010 - Need to track down the fullpage.sty latex package for 
malachite.

/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/preprint/fullpage.sty

texlive-latex-extra - TeX Live: LaTeX supplementary packages  <== This had fullpage.sty
texlive-publishers - TeX Live: Support for publishers         <== Installed for grins.

x Mar 11, 2010 - Need appropriate dist target for Makefile.
Added solid dist target to Makefile.

x Mar 11, 2010 - Need to get the VERSION variable to resolve in the
header.  i.e. Not when referenced in targets below.

Updated definition of VERSION to use shell command to resolve MAJOR, MINOR, 
and PATCH on the spot.

# Build VERSION number from MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH
# The use of shell resolves the cat, grep, cut, and tr commands       
# before executing targets.
VERSION = $(shell echo ${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH})
